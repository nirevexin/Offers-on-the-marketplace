## Formulation of the problem
- In this competition, we invite you to solve one of the practical problems of the matching and machine learning team.
The matching and machine learning team works with offers from marketplace sellers, assortments, and competitors’ products.

- We work with images, texts, tabular data and use deep learning and computer vision models.

- Here, we offer a product matching task:
  - You have to implement the final part of the matching pipeline. In it, you must decide for each pair (product offered by the seller - product on the site) whether it is a match or not (binary classification).
To do this, each pair has a set of features and sets of vectors (picture and text) that describe the products from this pair.

- F-score is used as a solution quality metric.
